# Azure Functions API - Conversion Status

## Challenge Discovered

Converting the Express backend to Azure Functions is more complex than initially estimated:
- 15+ endpoints to convert
- Each endpoint needs individual Azure Function
- Cosmos DB requires different data access patterns than PostgreSQL
- Business logic is tightly coupled with PostgreSQL

## Estimated Time
- Full conversion: 20-30 hours
- Current progress: 2/15 functions (login, register)

## Recommendation

Given the Azure App Service quota limitation, we have 3 options:

### Option 1: Complete Azure Functions Conversion (20-30 hours)
- Pros: Fully Azure, modern serverless
- Cons: Significant time investment

### Option 2: Wait for Azure Support (1-48 hours)
- Pros: Deploy original code as-is
- Cons: Unknown timeline, Microsoft support dependency

### Option 3: Create Express-to-Functions Adapter (3-4 hours)
- Pros: Reuse existing code, faster deployment
- Cons: Less "Azure native", workaround approach

## Current Status

- ‚ùå App Service still quota blocked
